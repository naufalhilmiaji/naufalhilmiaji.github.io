<CodeSection title="# problem_statement">
Many backend training projects stop at simple CRUD and fail to demonstrate
**real architectural boundaries**, **authorization rules**, and
**ownership-aware business logic**.

dotnetwebapi was built to simulate a realistic backend system where
authentication, authorization, and infrastructure concerns must coexist
without leaking into each other.
</CodeSection>

<CodeSection title="# it_is_and_is_not">
### It **is**

- A Clean Architecture–based ASP.NET Core Web API
- A training project for backend system design
- An example of JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- A simulation of an ordering backend with real constraints

### It **is not**

- A production-ready e-commerce system
- A frontend-facing application
- A reusable framework or library
</CodeSection>

<CodeSection title="# usage_overview">
The API exposes endpoints for:

- User registration and login (JWT)
- Order creation with multiple items
- Role-aware order access (ADMIN vs USER)
- Order status updates
- Notifications and reporting features

Business rules are enforced in the **application layer**, not in controllers.

<CodeSection title="# minimal_example">
<CodeBlock language="http">
```http
POST /api/orders
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="json">
```json
{
  "customerId": "<GUID>",
  "items": [
    {
      "productName": "Mouse",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 150000
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Access to this endpoint depends on user role and ownership rules.

Not applicable.

This project focuses on **deterministic backend logic** rather than
LLM-assisted behavior.

<CodeSection title="# usage_scenarios">
* Backend Clean Architecture training
* JWT authentication & authorization exercises
* EF Core + SQL Server practice
* Ownership-aware business rule implementation
* SignalR and email integration examples

<CodeSection title="# project_status">
dotnetwebapi is a **training-focused backend project** intended for
architectural learning and system design practice.

The codebase prioritizes clarity and separation of concerns over feature
completeness.
