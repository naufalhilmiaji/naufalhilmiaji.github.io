<CodeSection title="# problem_statement">
Many applications need map features such as place search or directions,
but implementing this logic usually involves:

- complex query parsing
- multiple map APIs
- vendor lock-in and billing requirements

**directio** allows applications to accept **natural-language map requests**
and turn them into **structured, map-ready results** without relying on
paid or hosted services.
</CodeSection>

<CodeSection title="# it_is_and_is_not">
### It **is**
- A backend API for natural-language place search and routing
- A bridge between user intent and deterministic map execution
- Designed to be consumed by web or mobile applications

### It **is not**
- A frontend map library
- A general-purpose chatbot
- A hosted LLM or map service
</CodeSection>

---

<CodeSection title="# usage_overview">
1. A user sends a natural-language query
2. A local LLM extracts intent and parameters
3. Backend providers execute geocoding or routing
4. The API returns clean JSON for rendering on a map

The LLM is used **only for intent extraction**.
All external calls are handled by deterministic backend logic.

<CodeSection title="# local_llm_preference">
**directio** uses a **local LLM** (via Ollama) to:

* avoid sending user data to third-party APIs
* keep behavior predictable and inspectable
* ensure the system is fully runnable offline

The LLM never calls map services directly.
</CodeSection>

<CodeSection title="# usage_scenarios">
**directio** is suitable for:

* map-based applications
* location-aware dashboards
* prototypes and demos without billing setup
* systems that value transparency over black-box APIs

It is not intended for high-traffic or latency-sensitive production use.
</CodeSection>

<CodeSection title="# project_status">
**directio** is under active development, focusing on:

* stable intent extraction
* place search and routing
* clean API contracts
* safe usage limits
