title: directio
---

## What problem does this solve?

Many applications need map features such as place search or directions,
but implementing this logic usually involves:

- complex query parsing
- multiple map APIs
- vendor lock-in and billing requirements

**directio** allows applications to accept **natural-language map requests**
and turn them into **structured, map-ready results** without relying on
paid or hosted services.

---

## What directio is (and is not)

### It **is**
- A backend API for natural-language place search and routing
- A bridge between user intent and deterministic map execution
- Designed to be consumed by web or mobile applications

### It **is not**
- A frontend map library
- A general-purpose chatbot
- A hosted LLM or map service

---

## Typical usage flow

1. A user sends a natural-language query
2. A local LLM extracts intent and parameters
3. Backend providers execute geocoding or routing
4. The API returns clean JSON for rendering on a map

The LLM is used **only for intent extraction**.
All external calls are handled by deterministic backend logic.

## Minimal example

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: directio_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{"message":"Where can I eat ramen near Sudirman Jakarta?"}'
````

Example response:

```json
{
  "intent": "find_places",
  "summary": "Ramen places near Sudirman Jakarta",
  "places": [
    {
      "name": "Ramen 38",
      "lat": -6.2275566,
      "lon": 106.809542
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why local LLMs?

directio uses a **local LLM** (via Ollama) to:

* avoid sending user data to third-party APIs
* keep behavior predictable and inspectable
* ensure the system is fully runnable offline

The LLM never calls map services directly.

---

## When should you use this?

directio is suitable for:

* map-based applications
* location-aware dashboards
* prototypes and demos without billing setup
* systems that value transparency over black-box APIs

It is not intended for high-traffic or latency-sensitive production use.

## Project status

directio is under active development, focusing on:

* stable intent extraction
* place search and routing
* clean API contracts
* safe usage limits
