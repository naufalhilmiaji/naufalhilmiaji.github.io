title: broadcastio
---

## What problem does this solve?

Backend systems often need to send **notifications, alerts, or reports**
across multiple delivery channels that fail in different and unpredictable ways.

Typical issues include:

- One provider being temporarily unavailable
- Partial delivery across channels
- Silent failures without clear error signals

**broadcastio** acts as a **single orchestration layer**
that attempts delivery across providers with **explicit failure semantics**.

---

## What broadcastio is (and is not)

### It **is**
- A Python **orchestration layer** for outbound messages
- A way to attempt delivery across one or more providers
- A library with **ordered fallback and retry logic**
- Designed for alerts, reports, and backend-triggered notifications

### It **is not**
- A chatbot framework
- An inbound message handler
- A WhatsApp automation system by itself

---

## Typical usage flow

1. Register one or more delivery providers
2. Define a message payload
3. Dispatch via the orchestrator
4. Inspect delivery result and failures explicitly

The caller always receives a **deterministic result object** —
even when delivery fails.

## Minimal example

```python
from broadcastio.core.orchestrator import Orchestrator
from broadcastio.providers.whatsapp import WhatsAppProvider
from broadcastio.core.message import Message

wa = WhatsAppProvider("http://localhost:3000")
orch = Orchestrator([wa])

result = orch.send(
    Message(
        recipient="6281234567890",
        content="Service is down"
    )
)

print(result.success)
````

---

## Failure-aware by design

broadcastio distinguishes clearly between:

* **Exceptions** → configuration or programmer errors
* **Delivery results** → delivery was attempted but failed

```python
if not result.success:
    print(result.error.code, result.error.message)
```

This makes failures **observable and actionable** instead of silent.

---

## When should you use this?

broadcastio is well-suited for:

* Infrastructure alerts
* Scheduled backend reports
* Operational notifications
* Systems that require **defensive delivery guarantees**

It is intentionally **not optimized** for conversational flows.

---

## Providers & architecture note

Providers (WhatsApp, Email, etc.) are implemented as **adapters**.

For example:

* WhatsApp delivery relies on an **external Node.js service**
  based on WhatsApp Web
* This service is **not bundled** with the Python package

The provider layer is intentionally swappable.

## Project status

* Status: **Alpha**
* APIs may evolve before 1.0.0
* Core orchestration logic is tested and stable
