You are a senior frontend architect and UI/UX designer specializing in developer portfolios.

I have an existing portfolio built with:

* Astro
* MDX
* Tailwind CSS
* Deployed as static site

The current design works functionally but feels:

* Flat
* Generic
* Not premium
* Lacking strong visual identity
* Not “senior backend engineer” level

Your task is to **redesign the entire theme system**, not just tweak colors.

## 🎯 Objective

Create a design that feels:

* Elegant
* Modern (2026-level aesthetics)
* Clean but not boring
* Technical, subtle programming vibes
* Minimal but strong personality
* Dark-mode first (with proper light mode support)

This portfolio represents:

Backend Engineer
Infrastructure-focused
Automation-heavy systems
API architecture
Docker / Linux / Monitoring
AI agents

The design must reflect:
System thinking. Stability. Precision. Intelligence.

Not flashy startup hype.

## 🧠 Design Direction

Style inspiration:

* Linear.app
* Vercel
* Raycast
* Modern DevTools UI
* Minimal system dashboards
* Terminal-inspired accents (subtle)

Avoid:

* Template-looking themes
* Oversaturated gradients
* Random colorful blobs
* Cartoonish elements
* Overused Tailwind boilerplate look

---

## 🎨 Visual Requirements

### 1. Color System

* Dark-first theme
* Deep charcoal background (not pure black)
* Subtle layered surfaces
* Controlled accent color (choose ONE primary accent)
* Accent used only for:

  * Links
  * Buttons
  * Highlights
  * Timeline markers
* Soft border usage (1px subtle contrast borders)
* Use semantic color tokens (not raw Tailwind classes everywhere)

Design a proper design token structure.

### 2. Typography

* Clean modern font pairing
* Strong hierarchy
* Good line height
* Generous spacing
* Make reading long MDX articles enjoyable
* Improve code block styling
* Improve inline code styling
* Improve blockquotes

---

### 3. Layout Improvements

Redesign these sections:

#### Hero Section

* Strong intro
* Subtle animated accent (not distracting)
* Professional positioning statement
* Clean call-to-action buttons

#### Experience Section

* Vertical timeline
* Elegant left-border or center-line design
* Subtle hover states
* Clean spacing
* Date alignment consistent
* No clutter

#### Projects Section

* Card redesign
* Better hover effect
* Clean metadata layout
* Tag styling refined
* Subtle depth (no heavy shadows)

#### Blog (MDX)

* Beautiful article layout
* Clean headings
* Elegant separators
* Code block polish
* Reading width optimized
* Table styling improved

---

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

* Keep Astro structure
* Keep MDX support
* Use Tailwind but abstract styling into reusable components
* Create:

  * `Section.astro`
  * `Card.astro`
  * `Timeline.astro`
  * `Container.astro`
* Extract consistent spacing system
* Remove visual inconsistency
* No inline messy utility spam
* Clean component architecture

---

## ✨ Micro-interactions

Add subtle and professional:

* Soft hover transitions (200–300ms)
* Button hover lift (very subtle)
* Timeline highlight on hover
* Link underline animation (minimal)
* Smooth scroll behavior
* Optional subtle gradient noise texture

No heavy animation libraries.

---

## 🧩 Deliverables

1. Updated global design system
2. Tailwind config improvements
3. Example layout implementation
4. Redesigned Hero
5. Redesigned Timeline
6. Redesigned Project Card
7. Redesigned MDX typography styling
8. Clear explanation of design decisions

---

## 🧭 Important

This is not a Dribbble experiment.

This is a senior backend engineer portfolio.

It must feel:

* Structured
* Reliable
* Intelligent
* Understated
* High-end

Avoid trendy gimmicks.

Make it look like someone who builds infrastructure for real companies.
You may decide the color theme the way you like.
